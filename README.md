## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about background images and positioning with the appropraiate responsive widths. As shown in the example below ðŸ‘‡
```css
.image { 
        padding-top: 0px;
        margin-left: 0px;
        background: url(images/bg-pattern-mobile.svg);
        background-repeat: no-repeat; 
        background-position: 45% 10%;
        padding-bottom: 50%;
        background-size: 80%;
    }
```
I also learnt to hide and show sections with just a few lines of javascript as illustrated below ðŸ‘‡
```js
const faqs = document.querySelectorAll(".faq");
        faqs.forEach((faq) => {
            faq.addEventListener("click", () => {
                faq.classList.toggle("active");
            });
        });
```

### Useful resources

During the course of this project, I found this platform very much helpful 
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - It helped me in having thorough understanding of background images and  image positioning and size proportion.
